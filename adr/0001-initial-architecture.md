# ADR-0001: Initial Architecture Decision

## Status
Accepted

## Date
2025-01-27

## Context
The TrainStation Dashboard is a comprehensive venue management system built with modern web technologies. We need to establish the foundational architectural decisions that guide the development and refactoring of the application.

## Decision
We will use the following architectural stack and patterns:

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized builds
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom component library
- **State Management**: React Context + TanStack Query for server state
- **Routing**: React Router v6 with lazy loading

### Backend Integration
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL) for data persistence
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth with role-based access control
- **Real-time**: Supabase real-time subscriptions
- **File Storage**: Supabase Storage for file management

### Development Tools
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript with strict mode
- **Code Quality**: ESLint + Prettier for consistency
- **Testing**: Vitest + Testing Library for modern testing
- **Performance**: PWA with service worker for offline capabilities

## Rationale

### React 18 + TypeScript
- Modern React patterns with concurrent features
- Strong type safety and developer experience
- Large ecosystem and community support
- Future-proof with React 19 migration path

### Vite Build System
- Significantly faster than Create React App
- Modern ES modules support
- Excellent development experience with HMR
- Optimized production builds

### Supabase Backend
- Rapid development with built-in auth and real-time
- PostgreSQL provides robust data management
- Excellent TypeScript integration
- Scalable infrastructure

### TanStack Query
- Excellent server state management
- Built-in caching and synchronization
- Optimistic updates and background refetching
- Better than manual useEffect patterns

## Consequences

### Positive
- Fast development velocity with modern tooling
- Type safety reduces runtime errors
- Excellent developer experience
- Scalable architecture for future growth
- Strong performance characteristics

### Negative
- Learning curve for team members new to these technologies
- Dependency on Supabase for backend services
- Bundle size considerations with rich feature set

### Neutral
- Need to maintain expertise in multiple technologies
- Regular updates required for dependencies

## Implementation Notes
- All new components should use TypeScript strict mode
- Prefer functional components with hooks over class components
- Use TanStack Query for all server state management
- Implement proper error boundaries for production stability
- Follow React 18+ patterns (avoid useEffect for derived state)

- ADR-0003: State Management Strategy (planned)
- ADR-0004: Performance Optimization Approach (planned)

## Review Date
This decision should be reviewed in Q3 2025 or when considering React 19 migration.
